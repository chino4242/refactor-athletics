# Macro Logging Fix - Summary

## 🔴 Problem
Macros (protein, carbs, fat) were not saving when logged from mobile in production.

## 🔍 Root Cause
`NutritionTracker.tsx` was calling `logHabit()` which makes a fetch request to `/api/habit/log` - **an API route that doesn't exist in the codebase**.

```tsx
// OLD (broken):
await logHabit(userId, habitId, finalVal, userProfile.bodyweight, label);
```

The function failed silently with no user feedback.

## ✅ Solution
Replaced `logHabit()` with `logHabitAction()` - a Next.js Server Action that already exists and works correctly.

```tsx
// NEW (working):
await logHabitAction(userId, habitId, finalVal, userProfile.bodyweight, label);
```

### Changes Made:
1. **src/components/NutritionTracker.tsx**
   - Removed `logHabit` import from `../services/api`
   - Added `logHabitAction` import from `@/app/actions`
   - Replaced 2 calls to `logHabit()` with `logHabitAction()`

## ✅ Testing
- Build: ✅ Successful
- Tests: ✅ All 168 tests passing (2 skipped)
- Ready for production deployment

## 📊 Why This Works
`logHabitAction` is a Server Action that:
- Directly inserts into Supabase (no API route needed)
- Already used successfully in `DailyQuest` component
- Has proper error handling
- Calls `revalidatePath('/')` to refresh UI

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional)
See `MACRO_LOGGING_ANALYSIS.md` for:
- Database indexing recommendations (10-100x faster queries)
- Materialized views for instant daily totals
- Long-term schema optimization (separate tables by domain)
